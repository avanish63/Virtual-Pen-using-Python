Virtual Pen System is a software designed to draw shapes in 3D space. This will be achieved by tracking movement of finger using hand detection using Mediapipe. It can also be used to draw free-hand. The user can experience the joy of writing or drawing in a 3D free space with ease as the application is user friendly. The peripheral drawing tablets are indeed expensive. This is where the digital pen truly shines. Being entirely software driven with a decent device and lots of modifications, it can be the first choice of digital artists as well as common users to draw/ create and for typing i.e., writing too. The current application is developed using Mediapipe, OpenCV and other supporting libraries in python.
